      <p>
        Greetings! I'm a <strong>21-year-old</strong> student currently pursuing
        a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Informatics</strong>{" "}
        at the <strong>University of Ljubljana</strong>, following a solid
        academic journey at <strong>Gimnazija Franceta Pre≈°erna</strong>.{" "}
        <i>Sporting</i> has been a significant part of my life, with{" "}
        <strong>13 years</strong> dedicated to{" "}
        <strong>competitive swimming</strong>, including participation in
        prestigious events like the <i>European Youth Olympic Festival</i> and
        the <i>European Junior Championships</i>. These experiences instilled in
        me <u>discipline</u>, <u>perseverance</u>, and the ability to{" "}
        <u>thrive under pressure</u>. Beyond the pool, my passion lies in
        exploring the vast realm of computer science, constantly seeking to{" "}
        <strong>innovate, create</strong>, and <strong>learn new skills</strong>
        . Outside of academia, I maintain a healthy lifestyle through activities
        such as <strong>mountain biking</strong> and regular{" "}
        <strong>gym sessions</strong>, fostering a well-rounded approach to
        personal and professional growth.
